# MindOps

Welcome to **MindOps**, a collection of research‐driven projects exploring the future of
observability and autonomous operations.  Each project in this repository tackles a
specific challenge in modern cloud systems and proposes an innovative solution that
combines state–of–the–art instrumentation, machine learning and AI‐assisted
analysis.  Over time this repository will host multiple projects under the
MindOps umbrella.  The first project, described below, implements an
intelligent telemetry system called **Cost‑Aware Adaptive Telemetry (CAAT)**.

## Why MindOps exists (the problem)

Modern enterprises run dozens to hundreds of microservices across multiple clouds. Observability
data is exploding in volume, yet reliability teams still struggle with:

- **Telemetry overload**: too much data, too little signal.
- **Slow RCA**: incident resolution depends on manual correlation across logs, traces, and metrics.
- **Cost uncertainty**: tracing/logging cost spikes during incidents.
- **Compliance risk**: sensitive data leaks into observability pipelines.
- **Fragmented tooling**: teams stitch together multiple platforms with no unified control plane.

MindOps solves this by treating observability as an **adaptive, intelligent system** that continuously
learns, optimizes cost, and guides operators toward the most likely root causes.

## What’s unique about MindOps

| Unique capability | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| **Closed‑loop observability** | Decisions (sampling, probes, SLOs) feed back into collection in real time. |
| **Trace‑native intelligence** | Root cause analysis uses real traces as first‑class context, not just docs. |
| **Cost‑aware policies** | Telemetry budget engine + RL policy keeps spend under control. |
| **Security & privacy guardrails** | PII is scrubbed before data reaches downstream systems. |
| **Composable constellation** | Each project is modular but designed to interoperate. |

## Where MindOps fits in the ecosystem

| Layer | MindOps role | Example integrations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Instrumentation** | Auto‑discovers + configures OTEL collectors | OpenTelemetry, eBPF |
| **Observability** | Feeds traces/logs/metrics to backends | Jaeger, Prometheus, Grafana |
| **AI/RCA** | Synthesizes telemetry into RCA reports | OpenAI models, vector stores |
| **Governance** | Enforces SLOs + redacts PII | CI gates, SIEMs |

## How enterprises can use MindOps

- **SRE/Platform teams**: run Zero‑Touch Telemetry to auto‑wire instrumentation.
- **Reliability teams**: use SLO Copilot to define testable objectives.
- **Incident response**: run T‑RAG + Topology RCA for faster root cause.
- **Finance/Ops**: apply CAAT to control telemetry spend without losing signal.
- **Security/Compliance**: add PII Guardrail before telemetry leaves the cluster.

## Why enterprises adopt MindOps

| Outcome | Impact |
| --- | --- |
| Faster MTTR | RCA suggestions grounded in traces and topology |
| Lower observability cost | Sampling and budgeting automate spend control |
| Better coverage | eBPF bot ensures instrumentation gaps are closed |
| Safer data | Pre‑ingest redaction reduces privacy risk |
| Unified tooling | One constellation vs many disconnected systems |

## Projects

This repository follows a modular layout under the `projects/` directory.  Each
subdirectory contains a self‑contained project along with its code, deployment
scripts, documentation and examples.  A brief overview of the planned
projects is provided below.  Projects 1 through 7 are implemented at the moment;
the remaining projects are placeholders for future work.
