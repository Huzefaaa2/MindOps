# Topology Graph Root Cause Analysis Engine

Project 7 of MindOps will build a multi‑cloud topology graph and use
graph algorithms to diagnose root causes of incidents.  Unlike
traditional dashboards that show only symptoms, this engine will
correlate causes across services, networks and infrastructure using
graph traversal and machine learning.

Implementation coming soon.
