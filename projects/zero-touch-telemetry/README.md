# Zero‑Touch Telemetry for Kubernetes

Project 5 of MindOps aims to simplify observability by automating
collector setup in Kubernetes environments.  Instead of manually
configuring exporters and sidecars, Zero‑Touch Telemetry will
automatically discover services and deploy the right collectors with
minimal intervention.

Implementation coming soon.
