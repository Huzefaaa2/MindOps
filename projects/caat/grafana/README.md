# Grafana Dashboards

This directory contains sample Grafana dashboards for visualising CAAT
metrics and insights.  The JSON files can be imported into Grafana via
the UI or configured to load automatically through provisioning.

At present the dashboard is a placeholder; you can design your own
panels to monitor telemetry volumes, RL actions, budget forecasts and
AI summaries.  To get started, open Grafana, navigate to **Create →
Import**, and paste the contents of `caat-overview.json` into the
import dialog.
