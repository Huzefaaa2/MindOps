# PII Guardrail Pre‑Ingest

Project 6 of MindOps will introduce a privacy‑aware guardrail that
redacts sensitive data before it enters observability pipelines.
Using ML and pattern matching, it will detect personally identifiable
information (PII) in logs and traces and mask or anonymise it,
helping teams comply with data protection regulations.

Implementation coming soon.
