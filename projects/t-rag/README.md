# Trace‑Native RAG for Root Cause (T‑RAG)

This directory is a placeholder for Project 2 of the MindOps
initiative.  The goal of T‑RAG is to build an AI assistant that
leverages trace data and retrieval‑augmented generation to perform
root cause analysis.  The project will align with CAAT and other
components to deliver cognitive observability.

Implementation coming soon.
