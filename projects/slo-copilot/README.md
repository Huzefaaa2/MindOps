# SLO Copilot + Trace‑Based Testing

Project 4 of MindOps will focus on improving the reliability of
distributed systems by combining Service Level Objective (SLO) testing
with trace‑based analysis.  The SLO Copilot will generate and
validate SLOs, run synthetic trace‑driven tests and produce code that
enforces reliability guarantees.

Implementation coming soon.
