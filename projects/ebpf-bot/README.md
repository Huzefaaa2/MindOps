# eBPF Coverage Bot

This directory is a placeholder for Project 3 of MindOps.  The eBPF
Coverage Bot will monitor observability blind spots and suggest or
automatically insert additional instrumentation (e.g. eBPF probes)
when metrics or traces are missing.  It aims to ensure that
important parts of the system are fully covered by telemetry.

Implementation coming soon.
